      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love exploration. When I was a kid, I spent most of my time wandering around the roads and woods near my house.&#xA;I would leave after school on my bike and or roller blades and try to find roads parts of my neighborhood I&amp;rsquo;d never seen,&#xA;or I would walk along the creek that ran though my backyard all the way to where it met the Pearl River.&#xA;I still am always hoping to find new ways to get from place to place in Philly. Exploration is the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
