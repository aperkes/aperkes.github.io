      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in July, I got to present at the Animal Behavior Society (ABS) virtual conference.&#xA;ABS is always a bit intense, not because the people are mean or intimidating,&#xA;I feel like ABS is one of the most welcoming conferences I&amp;rsquo;ve participated in.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s just so much. Most of the talks are 15-30 minutes, and they have about 4 parallel sessions going at once,&#xA;So you spend all day, for several days, running around the venue trying to get to the talks that you want to catch,&#xA;and inevitably you are faced with some impossible dilemmas and you just have to choose.&#xA;A friend of mine described it as a &amp;ldquo;science bender&amp;rdquo;, which I think is pretty accurate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love exploration. When I was a kid, I spent most of my time wandering around the roads and woods near my house.&#xA;I would leave after school on my bike and or roller blades and try to find roads parts of my neighborhood I&amp;rsquo;d never seen,&#xA;or I would walk along the creek that ran though my backyard all the way to where it met the Pearl River.&#xA;I still am always hoping to find new ways to get from place to place in Philly. Exploration is the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
