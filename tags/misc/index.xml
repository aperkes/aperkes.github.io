      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love exploration. When I was a kid, I spent most of my time wandering around the roads and woods near my house.&#xA;I would leave after school on my bike and or roller blades and try to find roads parts of my neighborhood I&amp;rsquo;d never seen,&#xA;or I would walk along the creek that ran though my backyard all the way to where it met the Pearl River.&#xA;I still am always hoping to find new ways to get from place to place in Philly. Exploration is the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was 13 or so, I started a Livejournal. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember who got me into Livejournal,&#xA;but I spent hours writing updates, working on my background, color scheme, and profile pics.&#xA;(I think if you had the unpaid version you got a total of three profile picture slots. Memory was&#xA;pretty sparse back then it seems.)&#xA;When facebook came around, I gradually transitioned over. (I remember feeling strongly about the fact&#xA;that facebook was stupid and would never catch on.)&#xA;Like all of us, as Facebook got bigger, I stopped updating by livejournal, or the blogger that replaced it.&#xA;And then I moved to Twitter. Oh, and then I got married, and I had someone to talk to,&#xA;so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have this compulsion to write down all my thoughts on a carefully designed page.&#xA;So this all feels like a return to form, albeit 18 years later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
