      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;careful-analysis-of-aviary-data&#34;&gt;Careful Analysis of Aviary Data&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of behavioral data exists that can be used to test hypotheses or identify new ones for future experiments.&#xA;Often this comes down to wrangling old data and looking at it in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions-for-trapping-and-studying-cowbirds&#34;&gt;Solutions for trapping and studying cowbirds&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prior to joining the lab, neither I nor anyone in the lab had trapped or housed cowbirds.&#xA;The older Schmidt lab work had been done in collaboration with David White, who was at the time&#xA;located nearby, so when we were setting out on our own, there were a lot of new things to learn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Modeling Social Behavior</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-puzzle-of-monogamy&#34;&gt;The Puzzle of Monogamy&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cowbirds are monogamous, but as far as we know there is no parental care from males or females,&#xA;and no obvious contribution from males to females outside of gene transfer. Given this, why are cowbirds monogamous?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;posture-in-a-box&#34;&gt;Posture in a box&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cowbirds, like many birds, perform Copulation Solicitation Displays in response to sound playbacks.&#xA;One of the original aims of our cowbird work was to record neural activity and correlate it with CSD.&#xA;To do this, we needed a quantitative representation of CSD, and pose generally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Smart Aviary</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-new-approach-to-behavioral-observation&#34;&gt;A new approach to behavioral observation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What started as a bit of a pipe dream has grown into a fully fledged project.&#xA;I joined the lab to have the opportunity to develop an aviary that could capture all behavioral&#xA;observations and provide an enormous dataset for behavioral analysis. This has been an enormous project,&#xA;and extremely satisfying to work on. We have recorded 2 seasons (200 days total) of behavior, and are&#xA;nearing completion on the taks of quantifying interractions. This has been a huge effort, and would not be possible&#xA;without the support of the NSF, incredible work by Bernd Pfrommer, Marc Badger, as well as a dozen others who&#xA;have contributed. See our &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;aviary project webbsite&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The &#39;Song&#39; System</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-not-so-dedicated-song-system&#34;&gt;The not so dedicated song system&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was actually the first project I worked on, and continues to be a major area of research&#xA;in the lab, although my focus is more on behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
