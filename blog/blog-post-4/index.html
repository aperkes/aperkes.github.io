<p>&ldquo;That Ammon Perkes is really coming along!&rdquo; ~Damian Woetzel, president of Julliard and artistic director of the Vail Dance Festival</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2020 has been a pretty strange year for me, and it&rsquo;s hard to remember
what all has happened. I&rsquo;ve spent the vast majority of the year working on
one paper that has sometimes felt like a bottomless pit of work and struggle.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this, the compounding crises have just been minor distractions.
I don&rsquo;t mean to undercut the very real danger and hardship people have faced,
but Chloe and I have been healthy, our jobs have continued, albeit over zoom. Our
home easily accommodates the two of us, and we&rsquo;re just the right mix of privilege to
avoid the worst of almost everything.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, it&rsquo;s been sort of frustrating for me that I haven&rsquo;t been able to
be more productive than I have. Why was it so hard for me to work, just because I was
forced to do it from my desk instead of my office? I went into this year planning
to complete my PhD, and I&rsquo;m wrapping up December exactly where I was last year:
accepting that my goal of submitting this paper by the end of the year
isn&rsquo;t going to happen.</p>
<p>There have been some highlights, and I will focus on them, to be a little more upbeat.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>I started feeling like a scientist.</strong>
Toward the end of 2019 I was feeling pretty bitter about where things were, and I expressed
a lot of that to my committee, and they basically told me to do my job and stop expecting my PI
to do it for me. Maybe I&rsquo;ll talk more about this idea later, but that really helped me to
realize that I was responsible to ensure my project was interesting and sound, and the last year
I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time transforming this paper from basically a bunch of crap that I hoped would
show off how clever I was, to some scholarship that I hope will actually inform the way people
think about animal behavior and evolution (and show off how clever I am. I still need to get a job.)
So that&rsquo;s been good, I&rsquo;m still not perfect in that, but it&rsquo;s been a big change. Related to that,
for the first time I presented some results at a conference that I was both confident
and excited about and I got some good feedback. I&rsquo;ve talked about this a bit on here before,
but it really is so much better to do science you&rsquo;re passionate about.</li>
<li><strong>I made a website!</strong>
This is still new for me, but it feels nice to be searchable.</li>
<li><strong>We published a paper!</strong>
This is not the massive first author paper that I&rsquo;m hinging my thesis on, but I got to do
some very cool work with a good friend, Luke Anderson. You can find it here:
<a href="https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1cJuYmjLu8ot">open access through February</a>. I&rsquo;ll probably
do a proper blog post all about it. This was a blast to work on, and I&rsquo;m really proud of the
work we did. We also published our first work on the smart aviary, which has been 5 years in the
making. It&rsquo;s awesome to have it out there, and there should be a lot more coming soon.</li>
<li><strong>I started rock climbing outside.</strong>
In the past, I climbed outside a lot, but not since moving to Philadelphia. This actually
feels a bit similar to taking responsibility for my own science. Maybe I&rsquo;ll make a combined post
about the two. In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll just say the Philly has some really fun bouldering,
and it&rsquo;s been a lifesaver for me (as have the crash pads Chloe bought me)</li>
<li><strong>I made my dance debut!</strong>
This was sort of silly, but it was a fun time. You can read about and watch it
<a href="https://omnia.sas.upenn.edu/story/biology-grad-student-makes-dance-debut-video">here</a>.
And now I can say I&rsquo;ve gotten a good review by Damian Woetzel, president of Julliard and
artistic director of the Vail Dance Festival.</li>
<li><strong>Zoom D&amp;D:</strong>
Maybe I&rsquo;ll do a post about Dungeons and Dragons sometime. I&rsquo;m always wary of getting too into my
hobbies, for fear some future employer will think &ldquo;No one who enjoys his hobbies so much will
be tenure track material.&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s been a really wonderful new part of my life.</li>
<li><strong>We&rsquo;re going to have a baby!</strong>
This should probably be a post in its own right, but Chloe and I decided we were ready
to take a crack at being parents. We&rsquo;re both very excited. Interestingly, it takes much less time and work
to create a human life than to make a decent paper. Stay tuned for updates on both, circa March, 2021.</li>
</ol>
<p>So all in all, 2020 has been an intense and very challenging year. But we have mercifully been
spared the worst of it, and it ended up being a year of some personal, professional, and fetal growth,
and I think we will look back fondly on 2020.</p>
<p>I know 2020 has gone a lot worse for a lot of people, there&rsquo;s nothing fair about how comfortable
this year has been for us while other people have had their lives completely devastated.
I&rsquo;m not sure what to do about that other than be grateful and try to make life less terrible
for other people.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to a new year of making life less terrible. And maybe figuring out blog formatting a bit better.
Honestly this thing is a mess.</p>
