      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in July, I got to present at the Animal Behavior Society (ABS) virtual conference.&#xA;ABS is always a bit intense, not because the people are mean or intimidating,&#xA;I feel like ABS is one of the most welcoming conferences I&amp;rsquo;ve participated in.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s just so much. Most of the talks are 15-30 minutes, and they have about 4 parallel sessions going at once,&#xA;So you spend all day, for several days, running around the venue trying to get to the talks that you want to catch,&#xA;and inevitably you are faced with some impossible dilemmas and you just have to choose.&#xA;A friend of mine described it as a &amp;ldquo;science bender&amp;rdquo;, which I think is pretty accurate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was 13 or so, I started a Livejournal. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember who got me into Livejournal,&#xA;but I spent hours writing updates, working on my background, color scheme, and profile pics.&#xA;(I think if you had the unpaid version you got a total of three profile picture slots. Memory was&#xA;pretty sparse back then it seems.)&#xA;When facebook came around, I gradually transitioned over. (I remember feeling strongly about the fact&#xA;that facebook was stupid and would never catch on.)&#xA;Like all of us, as Facebook got bigger, I stopped updating by livejournal, or the blogger that replaced it.&#xA;And then I moved to Twitter. Oh, and then I got married, and I had someone to talk to,&#xA;so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have this compulsion to write down all my thoughts on a carefully designed page.&#xA;So this all feels like a return to form, albeit 18 years later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
